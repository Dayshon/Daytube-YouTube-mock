<h1>UnFuck Yourself Audiobook</h1>

<p>This video is the audible version of the book "UnFuck Yourself Audibook", this is for those
   people that don't have the desired time to read but do have the time to listen.Unfuck 
   Yourself focuses more on one's approach and the journey than specific actions and goals. 
   This prevents emotions and thoughts from hindering our chances of success. This focus 
   also stops the toxic act of blaming others and external circumstances for your 
   failures, partly because the journey becomes so important. </p>
