<h1>Self Discipline</h1>

<p>This video is the audible version of the book "Self Discipline Audibook", this is for those
   people that don't have the desired time to read but do have the time to listen.Self-discipline 
   is about maintaining integrity between yourself and your own personal promises. This one simple
   thing: getting up when you intend to get up—and doing it the first time—is both a small win 
   and a big win at once… It's a small win because it's a small and simple action: alarm goes off,
   you get up. </p>
